### Second part of marble solitaire game

For the second part of the marble solitaire game I added in a controller and view for the board.

The controller is the only class that was allowed to manipulate the given board and after manipulating. 
The controller passes the new board state off to the view.

The view displays the given board state in the form of a string so the user can interpret their moves and the board visually.
