# Object Oriented Design (OOD)

This repository contains much of my code from my OOD class, taken in Fall 2021. Coded in Java and primarily focused on correct design patterns of object oriented work.

Big notable project would be the Image Processing Project I coded along with my partner, Wanru Shao.

Other homeworks show nice smaller projects.

Labs are just bonus examples.
